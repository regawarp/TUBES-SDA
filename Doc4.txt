REPUBLIKA.CO.ID, PORSEA -- Indonesian Transportation Minister Budi Karya Sumadi has inspected the construction of a roll-on-roll-off ship in Porsea, Toba Samosir district. It would serve shipping routes on Lake Toba.

Budi said the ship would travel from Tomok in Samosir district to Ajibata in Toba Samosir district. The ship would have the capacity to carry up to 280 passengers and 17 trucks, which is much larger than the current ship serving the route.

"It can carry some 30 cars," the minister added.

The government began construction of the ship in 2017. It is to begin operations in November 2018, Budi remarked.

"So during Christmas, we can use this ship," Budi said.

The ministry, he continued, would monitor the ship's operation to improve the tourism sector on Lake Toba, and increase shipping safety in the region. The government has planned to build another ship in the region that would be operated by state-run ferry operator PT ASDP on Lake Toba. A private firm would also donate two ships for transportation in North Sumatra.

He called on the Toba Samosir administration to assign a harbormaster who has the knowledge and commitment to assure safe shipping.

"We hope (local administration) could help monitor it, because safety is a priority," the minister said.
